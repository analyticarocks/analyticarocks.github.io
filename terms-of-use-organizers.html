Generals Provisions</h2><h3 id="2-1-subject-matter-of-contract">2.1 Subject matter of contract</h3><p>These Terms shall apply between B2MATCH and its client as well as all co-event-organizers relating to the client for all services offered by B2MATCH including, but not limited, to the use of a mobile app, which can be downloaded and installed through the app stores.

The right is limited in time for the duration of the contract and locally bound to the place of business of the client.</p><h3 id="2-2-b2match-agrees-to-provide-the-following-service">2.2 B2MATCH agrees to provide the following service</h3><p>The B2MATCH platform is a web- and app-based event management-, business matchmaking and communication platform.

B2MATCH therefore is active as an information service provider, who hosts and publishes third party content. Due to the plurality of such content, B2MATCH is neither obliged nor has the responsibility to check the content according to its factual or legal content. B2MATCH can access such content at any time and it will handle such content confidential and will only disclose it to third parties (if not made public by the client itself) if requested by any laws, a juridical or governmental order or with the consent of the client.</p><p>The client guarantees that his content provided on the platform does comply with applicable laws and does not violate any legal provisions, accepted principles of morality and or does not infringe any third-party rights.</p><p>The client agrees to comply with the relevant legal provisions and, in particular, not to infringe anyone’s rights to a name, trademark or other rights and will indemnify and hold B2MATCH harmless in this respect.</p><h3 id="4-3-content-lock-and-deletion">4.3 Content Lock and Deletion</h3><p>In case of a breach of the Terms agreed herein, B2MATCH shall be entitled to lock or delete client’s access data and or its other content from the Site and terminate the contract with the client with immediate effect.</p><h2 id="5-change-of-the-platform">5.

The client does not have a right to opt for the use of any older version of the platform but shall always use the most recent version.

Availability of Service</h2><p>The B2MATCH platform-service is provided non-stop, 365 days per year, except from any necessary repair work which cannot be delayed as well as limitations imposed by the network (cloud) availability or any operating conditions of telecommunications providers. During such times, the B2MATCH services may (e.g. due to maintenance services) not be continuously available. The client waives his right to claim for any damages, since such event shall be deemed force majeure.</p><h2 id="7-misuse-of-service">7. Misuse of Service</h2><p>Should the client or co-organizers materially breach any provisions of these Terms or any statutory laws as pointed out in this section 3.2, B2MATCH shall be entitled to temporarily or permanently lock the clients profile and or event websites as well as delete any unlawful data or information hosted on the platform.

B2MATCH´s liability for both gross and slight negligence shall be excluded. Any claim to compensation is in its amount limited to the double turnover of the client during the last fiscal year.
    The client takes note of the fact that B2MATCH is neither a party to nor an intermediary for any agreements between a client and a users (e.g. event participants) and/or data, but merely provides the client with the necessary infrastructure for an agreed fee. The client furthermore takes note of the fact, that B2MATCH in no way assumes the role of data provider for the submission of data, declarations of intent or any other declarations to other users. B2MATCH does not intervene in the communications between users of the platform.</p><p>Any claim for compensation shall be limited to the amount mentioned in the offer. B2MATCH shall be liable only for a damage resulting from any data processing if B2MATCH has not met the obligations resulting from the GDPR and specifically imposed on processors; or acted in breach of any lawful instructions from the principal; or acted against the lawfully issued instructions of the client.

Warranty</h2><p>The client takes note of the fact that it is not possible to develop the platform in such a way that it is free of any errors. B2MATCH warrants suitability of the Site as it is made available for use in accordance with the Terms of this Agreement and with the description of the program as described in the offer.</p><p>In case of substantial deviations of the program description, B2MATCH shall be required to rectify these.

The errors must be capable of being reproduced.</p><p>The warranty does not cover errors caused by non-intended use of the platform. If an error detection procedure indicates that the cause of an error is within the sphere or scope of responsibilities of the client, B2MATCH shall be entitled to charge the client for the corresponding and reasonable costs incurred at the rates currently applicable.</p><p>Security information, in particular with regard to repair times, availability, measures against data loss, security measures and the storage of security measures, firewalls, measures against spam, trojans, phishing and mail bombing can be provided upon request of the client.</p><h2 id="10-public-relation">10.
